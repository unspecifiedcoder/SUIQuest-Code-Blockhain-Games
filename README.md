## 💡 What is SuiQuest?

**SuiQuest** is a gamified learning and certification platform designed to **onboard and empower developers into the Sui blockchain ecosystem**. Our goal is to create a seamless, fun, and engaging way for developers to learn the Move language, practice smart contract development, and get certified through on-chain NFTs.

We’re bridging the gap between learning and doing—empowering devs to upskill, prove their abilities, and monetize their skills, all on-chain.

## ⚠️ The Problem

* 🌪️ **Scattered Information**: Learning Sui is fragmented across docs, tutorials, and scattered resources.

* ❌ **No Skill Verification**: Developers have no verifiable on-chain proof of Sui proficiency.

---
